The spawn region will have the same dimensions as the matching capture region. Blocks placed in the capture region will be converted into <b>Fake Blocks</b> with the same appearance and moved into the spawn region at the same position relative to the top-left corner of the spawn region. The converted blocks will remain on the same layer where they were originally placed."
