description = "A passthrough block that secret areas can be hidden behind. While the player is overlapping one of these blocks, the things behind the blocks are revealed in a small area around the player. The block will look like a block with the ID set in this block's ID field. It is recommended that you use <b>Fake Block Capturers</b> and <b>Fake Block Spawners</b> instead of placing these directly."
